## 1. Reddit r/webdev (Show Reddit / Project Showcase)

**Title:** I built 240+ free browser-based tools for developers — no login, no tracking, everything runs locally

**Body:**
Hey r/webdev,

Over the past few months I've been building NexTool — a collection of 240+ free developer tools that run entirely in your browser. No accounts, no data sent to any server, no tracking.

**Some highlights:**
- JSON Formatter, Validator, Viewer, Diff, Path Finder, Schema Generator
- Regex Tester, Builder, and Pattern Library
- CSS generators (Gradient, Flexbox, Grid, Animation, Box Shadow, Clip Path)
- Image Compressor, SVG Optimizer, Base64 Encoder
- Color tools (Palette Generator, Contrast Checker, Color Blindness Simulator)
- Code formatters (SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, YAML, XML)
- Converters (JSON-YAML, CSV-JSON, Markdown-HTML, Unix Timestamp)
- Security tools (Password Generator, Hash Generator, JWT Decoder)
- And 190+ more...

Everything is 100% client-side. Your data never leaves your browser. No ads, no popups.

**Why I built this:** I was tired of searching for individual tools across sketchy websites with ads everywhere. I wanted one clean place with everything a developer needs.

Check it out: https://nextool.app/free-tools/

The full tool list is at [nextool.app/free-tools](https://nextool.app/free-tools/). Everything is free. There's an optional Pro upgrade ($29 one-time) that removes banners and adds a Pro Toolbar, but all tools work fully without it.

Would love your feedback on which tools you find most useful and what's missing!

## 3. Reddit r/SideProject

**Title:** I built 240+ free browser-based developer tools — here's what I learned

**Body:**
Hey r/SideProject!

I've been working on NexTool — a collection of 240+ free browser-based tools for developers. Everything runs client-side, no tracking, no login required.

**What it is:** One site with every tool a developer commonly needs — JSON formatters, regex testers, CSS generators, color tools, image compressors, code formatters, calculators, converters, and more.

**Tech stack:** Pure HTML/CSS/JS. No frameworks. Each tool is a standalone page. Hosted on GitHub Pages.

**Revenue model:** All tools are 100% free. Optional Pro upgrade ($29 one-time) removes banners and adds enhanced features. Built with PayPal integration.

**What I learned:**
1. Building tools is the easy part. Getting traffic is the hard part.
2. SEO takes months. Don't expect overnight results from content.
3. Pure client-side tools are a massive trust signal — users love "your data stays local"
4. One good tool is worth more than 10 mediocre ones

**What's working:** The tools themselves are solid. Users who find them love them.

**What's not working (yet):** Distribution. I have 228 tools and 100+ blog articles but traffic is still ramping up.

Would love any advice on distribution channels that worked for your side projects!

**Tags:** webdev, tools, javascript, opensource

**Body:**

# I Built 228 Free Browser-Based Developer Tools

Every tool runs 100% in your browser. No login required. No data tracking. No ads.

## Why I Built This

I was tired of:
- Googling "json formatter online" and getting ad-infested sites
- Tools that upload my code to their servers
- Signing up for yet another account just to format some CSS

So I built one clean site with everything.

## Tool Categories

- [JSON Schema Generator](https://nextool.app/free-tools/json-schema-generator.html) — Generate schemas from data
- And 10+ more...

### CSS & Design (25+ tools)

- And more...

### Security & Encoding (10+ tools)
- [Password Generator](https://nextool.app/free-tools/password-generator.html) — Crypto-secure passwords
- [JWT Decoder](https://nextool.app/free-tools/jwt-decoder.html) — Decode without sharing secrets
- [Hash Generator](https://nextool.app/free-tools/hash-generator.html) — MD5, SHA-256, SHA-512

### And 150+ More
Color tools, image tools, text tools, network tools, math tools, conversion tools...

**Full list:** [nextool.app/free-tools](https://nextool.app/free-tools/)

## The Privacy Angle

Every tool runs client-side using vanilla JavaScript. Your data never leaves your browser. You can verify this by opening DevTools → Network tab while using any tool. Zero requests to external servers.

## Try It

[nextool.app/free-tools](https://nextool.app/free-tools/)

All tools are free. There's an optional Pro upgrade ($29) for a cleaner experience, but every tool is fully functional without it.
